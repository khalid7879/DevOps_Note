Docker Logs & Exec – Debugging Cheat Sheet

Rapid diagnosis. Minimal downtime. Controlled access.

1. Log Visibility (First Line of Defense)

Objective: Identify failures without disrupting service

docker logs <container>
docker logs -f <container>
docker logs --tail 100 <container>
docker logs --since 10m <container>


Value: Accelerates root-cause analysis and reduces MTTR.

2. Live Container Access (Controlled Intervention)

Objective: Inspect runtime state securely

docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash
docker exec -it <container> /bin/sh


Value: Enables real-time diagnostics without redeployment.

3. Process & Resource Inspection

Objective: Detect performance bottlenecks

docker stats
docker top <container>


Value: Supports capacity planning and performance tuning.

4. Configuration & Metadata Review

Objective: Validate runtime configuration

docker inspect <container>


Key insights:

Environment variables

Mounted volumes

Network bindings

Restart policies

5. Exit Codes & Failure Analysis

Objective: Understand crash patterns

docker ps -a
docker inspect <container> | grep ExitCode


Value: Drives preventive remediation strategies.
