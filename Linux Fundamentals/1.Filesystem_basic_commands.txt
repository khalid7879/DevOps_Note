1. The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy

Unlike Windows, which uses drive letters ($C:$, $D:$), 
Linux uses a single unified tree structure starting at the Root directory(/)
>>./bin & /usr/bin: Essential command binaries (like ls and cd)
>>./etc: Configuration files for the system.
>>/home: Personal folders for users (e.g., /home/username).
>>/root: The home directory for the system administrator (root user).
>>/tmp: Temporary files deleted on reboot.
>>/var: Variable data, like system logs and databases.

2. Navigation Commands
These are your "movement" tools to find your way around the tree.

Command,                 Action,                                        Example
pwd,                     Print Working Directory (Where am I?),         pwd
ls,                      List files and folders,ls -l (detailed list)
cd,                      Change Directory,cd /etc
cd ..,                   Move up one level,                             cd ..
cd ~,                    Go to your home directory,                     cd ~


3. File & Directory Operations
Tools for creating, moving, and destroying data.

mkdir [name]: Create a new directory.

touch [file]: Create an empty file.

cp [source] [dest]: Copy files or folders. (Use -r for folders).

mv [source] [dest]: Move or Rename a file.

rm [file]: Remove (delete) a file.

Warning: rm -rf deletes folders permanently without a "Trash bin." Use with caution!


4. Reading & Searching Files
You don't always need to open a full editor to see what's inside a file.

cat [file]: Dumps the entire content of a file into the terminal.

head / tail: Shows the first or last 10 lines of a file.

grep "word" [file]: Searches for a specific string inside a file.

find: Locates files within a directory tree based on name or type.

Copy and paste these (or type them) one by one to see how they work:

Create a workspace: mkdir linux_practice && cd linux_practice

Create a file with text: echo "Linux is powerful" > note.txt

Read the file: cat note.txt

Check permissions and details: ls -l

Rename the file: mv note.txt learning.txt

Clean up (Delete everything): cd .. && rm -rf linux_practice
