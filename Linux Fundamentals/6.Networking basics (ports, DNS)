1. IP Addresses & Interfaces
Every device on a network has an IP address. In Linux, these are attached to "interfaces" (
like your Ethernet port or Wi-Fi chip).

ip addr: Shows your current IP addresses and interfaces (e.g., eth0 or wlan0).

ping [IP/Domain]: Sends a tiny packet to see if a destination is "alive" and how fast 
the connection is.
