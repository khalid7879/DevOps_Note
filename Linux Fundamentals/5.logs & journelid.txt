1. The Journal (journalctl)
journald collects logs from the kernel, services, and applications. 
Because it's a binary database, you use the journalctl command to query it.

Goal,                       Command
Real-time logs,             journalctl -f (Follows logs as they happen)
Current boot only,          journalctl -b
Specific Service,           journalctl -u nginx.service
By Priority,                journalctl -p err (Shows only errors and higher)
By Time,                    "journalctl --since ""1 hour ago"""
Check Disk Usage,           journalctl --disk-usage


2. Traditional Log Files (/var/log)
While journalctl is powerful, many systems still write 
plain-text logs to /var/log for compatibility and easy reading with tools like grep or tail.

File Path,             What it contains
/var/log/syslog,       General system activity (Debian/Ubuntu).
/var/log/messages,     General system activity (RHEL/CentOS).
/var/log/auth.log,     "Login attempts, sudo usage, and SSH logs."
/var/log/kern.log,     "Kernel messages (hardware errors, drivers)."
/var/log/apache2/,     Web server access and error logs.

3. Log vs. Journal: Which one to use?
Use journalctl when troubleshooting a specific service that won't start or when you need
to filter by a very specific time range.

Use /var/log when you want to quickly grep through text files or when looking for 
security/login history in auth.log.

4. Reading Logs Like a Pro
Don't just use cat on a log file; it will flood your screen. Use these instead:

tail -f /var/log/syslog: Keeps the file open and prints new lines as they arrive.

less /var/log/syslog: Lets you scroll through the file and search (press / then type your search term).

grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog: Quickly find every line that contains the word "error" (case-insensitive).
