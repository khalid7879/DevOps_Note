1. Managing Processes (Monitoring & Killing)
Every process has a unique PID (Process ID).

Command,       Purpose,                              When to use it
ps aux,        Snapshot of all processes.,           When you want to find a specific PID using grep.
top,           "Live, auto-updating list.",          To see which app is hogging your CPU right now.
htop,          "Better, colorful version of top.",   For an interactive view (you can scroll and click).
kill [PID],    Stops a process gracefully.,          When an app is acting up but still responding.
kill -9 [PID], Forces a process to die.,             Use only as a last resort; it doesn't allow the app to save data.


2. Systemctl (Managing Background Services)
Most modern Linux distros use systemd, and systemctl is the tool used to talk to it. 
Services (like your web server or firewall) usually end in .service.

The Core Commands:
sudo systemctl start [service]: Starts it immediately.

sudo systemctl stop [service]: Shuts it down immediately.

sudo systemctl restart [service]: Turns it off and back on.

sudo systemctl status [service]: Shows if it's running, failed, and its recent logs.

Boot Management (Persistence):
sudo systemctl enable [service]: Makes the service start automatically when the computer boots up.

sudo systemctl disable [service]: Prevents it from starting at boot.


3. Understanding Service States
When you run systemctl status, look for these keywords:

Active (running): Everything is healthy.

Active (exited): This was a task that ran once and finished successfully (normal for some setup tasks).

Inactive (dead): The service is stopped.

Failed: The service crashed or couldn't start. (Look at the logs below the status for the error message!)


4. Reading the Logs (journalctl)
If a service fails, systemctl won't tell you why. You need to check the "journal":

journalctl -u [service]: Shows logs only for that specific service.

journalctl -xe: Shows the most recent system errors (the -e jumps to the end).
