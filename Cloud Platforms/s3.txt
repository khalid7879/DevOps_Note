S3 Core Concepts - Quick Reference
1. Buckets & Objects
Bucket: Container for objects (like a folder)

Globally unique name across all AWS

Regional scope (created in specific region)

Object: The actual file/data stored

Key: Full path/filename

Version ID: Unique for each object version

Metadata: System/user-defined data

2. Storage Classes
Frequent Access:

S3 Standard: Default, >99.99% availability

S3 Express-One Zone: Ultra-low latency (ms)

Infrequent Access:

S3 Standard-IA: Lower cost, rapid access

S3 One Zone-IA: 20% cheaper, single AZ

Archive:

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Archive with ms access

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: 1-5 min retrieval

S3 Glacier Deep Archive: 12-48 hr retrieval, lowest cost

3. Versioning
Purpose: Protect against accidental deletes/overwrites

When enabled: Every object gets unique VersionID

States:

Enabled: New versions protected

Suspended: New versions not protected, existing preserved

Cannot be disabled, only suspended

4. Lifecycle Rules
Automate moving objects between storage classes.

Transition Rules:

Move objects after X days

Example: Standard → Standard-IA (after 30 days) → Glacier (after 90 days)

Expiration Rules:

Delete old versions/delete markers

Example: Delete old versions after 365 days

5. Bucket Policies
JSON-based resource policies controlling bucket access.
