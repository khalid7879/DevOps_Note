IAM (Identity and Access Management) 
is a framework of policies, technologies, and processes that ensures the right individuals 
have the right access to the right resources for the right reasons.

Key Concepts
Authentication (AuthN): "Who are you?" - Verifies identity

Authorization (AuthZ): "What can you do?" - Verifies permissions

Principle of Least Privilege: Grant minimum required permissions only

Core Components
Users - People

Groups - User collections

Roles - For services/apps (uses temporary credentials)

Policies - JSON rules defining permissions

Critical Best Practices
✅ Never use Root account for daily tasks

✅ Enable MFA on all privileged accounts

✅ Use Roles for services (EC2, Lambda) - not stored keys

✅ Apply Least Privilege - start with no permissions

✅ Regular audit of users and policies

Creating IAM User with S3 Full Access (Programmatic)
Step 1: Navigate to IAM Console
Go to AWS Management Console

Search for "IAM" or find it under Services

Click "Users" in left sidebar

Click "Create user"

Step 2: Set User Details
User name: s3-admin-user (or your preferred name)

Select AWS credential type:

✅ Access key - Programmatic access (for CLI/SDK)

☐ AWS Management Console access (optional)

Step 3: Set Permissions
Select "Attach existing policies directly"

Search for S3 in policy filter

Check AmazonS3FullAccess

Alternative: For more restricted access, create custom policy

Step 4: Review and Create
Review settings

Click "Create user"

Step 5: Save Credentials ⚠️ IMPORTANT
Download CSV file - this is your ONLY chance to save these

File contains:

Access Key ID

Secret Access Key

Store securely - treat like passwords

Configure AWS CLI with New User

# Configure CLI with new credentials
aws configure

# Enter when prompted:
AWS Access Key ID: [PASTE_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
AWS Secret Access Key: [PASTE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
Default region: us-east-1 (or your preferred region)
Default output format: json


Test the Configuration

# List S3 buckets to verify access
aws s3 ls

# Create a test bucket
aws s3 mb s3://your-test-bucket-name

# List buckets again to confirm
aws s3 ls
