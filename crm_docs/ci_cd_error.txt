The Only Viable Resolution (Authoritative Path)

Step 1: Generate a GitHub-Specific Deploy Key

On the QC server (114.130.69.249):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_qc -C "qc-deploy-114.130.69.249"
No passphrase. This is a machine identity.

Step 2: Register the Public Key in GitHub
This is non-negotiable.
GitHub Repo → Settings → Deploy Keys
Add new key
Paste:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_qc.pub

Enable Read access

Save

This step establishes trust between GitHub and the server.

Step 3: Force SSH to Use the Correct Key

Create/update SSH config on the server:

vi ~/.ssh/config
Add exactly:
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_qc

  Then lock it down:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
This removes key ambiguity.

Step 4: Trust GitHub’s Host Key
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Re-Run the Control Check (This Is the Gate)
ssh -T git@github.com
Success state:
Hi <org-or-user>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Only after this passes should you proceed.
